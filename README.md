# Coin Flips Sim

This is a situation where you can flip as many coins as you want and once you stop, the proportion of heads to total flips will be the proportion of 1000000 dollars you get. I created a simple simulated annealing project which tries to find the best proportion to stop at to get the most money. Upon running this (which took forever), I found 0.731125658 as an ideal proportion. This translates to an average score over 1000 games of 0.7717225644074074. This is much, much better than the typical: "stop when you are over .5"
